# Apply-Probability-Distributions-in-dataset
in this Jupyter notebook we explain probability distributions and apply them in real datasets 

# Probability distributions 

In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment

# Installation
in this project we work with library called empiricaldist so we need to install it before apply the probability distributions.You can install it and read about this library through this link : https://pypi.org/project/empiricaldist/

# Why explain them ?

Statistics and probability are an integral part of data science, so if you want to become a unique data scientist, you must learn statistics and probability.

# Steps

1.We explain the basic concepts (i.e ... PMFs , CDFs , PDFs)

2.Explain the disceret probability distributions 

3.Explain the continuous probability distributions
